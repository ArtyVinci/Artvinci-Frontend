# âœ… Gallery Page Updated - Connected to Backend!

## What Was Done

### 1. **Updated Constants** (`src/utils/constants.js`)
- âœ… Updated `ART_CATEGORIES` to match backend (15 categories)
- âœ… Categories now use underscores (e.g., `digital_art`, `mixed_media`)

### 2. **Updated API Service** (`src/services/api.js`)
- âœ… Complete `artworkService` with all backend endpoints
- âœ… Support for slug-based URLs
- âœ… Added filters: category, search, price range, availability, featured
- âœ… Added pagination support
- âœ… Added like/unlike functionality
- âœ… Added image upload
- âœ… Added purchase functionality

### 3. **Updated Gallery Page** (`src/pages/gallery/Gallery.jsx`)
- âœ… Connected to real backend API
- âœ… Search functionality (searches title, description, tags)
- âœ… Category filter (all 15 categories)
- âœ… Price range filter (with min/max price)
- âœ… Sort options (newest, oldest, price_low, price_high, popular, views)
- âœ… Pagination (12 items per page)
- âœ… Debounced search (500ms delay)
- âœ… Loading states
- âœ… Empty states
- âœ… Error handling with toast notifications
- âœ… Like/Unlike artworks (requires login)

### 4. **Updated ArtworkCard** (`src/components/common/ArtworkCard.jsx`)
- âœ… Display primary_image from backend
- âœ… Show artist username
- âœ… Display likes count
- âœ… Display views count
- âœ… Show "Sold" badge if not available
- âœ… Format category names properly
- âœ… Link to `/gallery/{slug}`

### 5. **Updated Helpers** (`src/utils/helpers.js`)

## Need to Add Test Data?

If you don't have artworks in the database yet, you can:

Would you like me to create test data or build the Artwork Detail page next?
